The sub-problems' independence is critical. Dependent sub-problems must be solved using SERIAL. When we write scripts to solve problems in parallel, the scripts have no knowledge of each other."

Eventually, the solution to the last problem is the solution to the original problem. When we write scripts to solve problems serially,  the output of each script is passed to the next."
